% Fractional type of decorrelation methods (BSSTk and weighted-BSST/k) are introduced in our paper, 
“Weighted Blind Source Separation Can Decompose the Frequency Mismatch Response by Deviant Concatenation: An Meg Study. Front. Neurol. 13:762497. Doi. 10.3389/fneur.2022.762497” 

% Acknowledgment
These MATLAB-based coding (BSS_func_kishida.m, corrm.m, joint_diag_real.m, weightedBSS_main.m) are based on previous works of Drs. Jean-Francois Cardoso, Shiro Ikeda and Hidekazu Fukai. 
We appreciate them.
